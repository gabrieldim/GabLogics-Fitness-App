#### *The backend will be added soon.

### My idea of the functions that such a system should have are the following:
- <b> Exercises for each muscle group of the body. </b> Better physical appearance through exercise is actually the main goal of this system. 
For this purpose, on this web application users will have the opportunity to see which exercises are recommended and how they are performed correctly.

- <b> Water drinking reminder. </b> For physical health and normal functioning of the body it is necessary to enter a certain amount of water daily, usually at least 2 liters.

- <b> Calories calculation. </b> Daily calorie intake is one of the key things to look for. For that reason, 
it will be possible to calculate the calories from the food that the user consumes on a daily basis.

- <b> Motivational messages. </b> Motivation can be easily lost. Because of this, users will receive daily messages to continue practicing and 
disciplining to get closer to their goal.

- <b> How many calories are expended in each activity. </b> For each of the exercises that will be available on the web application you can see how many calories would be consumed. This amount will be a quick basis per hour.

- <b> Tips for proper nutrition. </b> As I said, nutrition plays a big role in leading a healthy life. For this reason, there will be additional tips on proper and healthy eating.

- <b> Exercise reminder. </b> We all have many daily responsibilities and it is easy to forget some of them. The user will receive an additional reminder every day 
to perform their exercises that they plan for that day.
